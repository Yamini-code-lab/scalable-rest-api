# Scalable REST API with Authentication & Role-Based Access Control

## Overview

This project is a full-stack application that demonstrates a scalable backend architecture with authentication, authorization, and CRUD functionality, along with a basic React frontend for testing and interaction.

The system implements secure user authentication using JWT, role-based access control, and a task management module. It also includes API documentation, validation, and security best practices.

## Features

### Backend Features

- User registration and login system
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (User / Admin)
- Protected routes using middleware
- CRUD operations for Task entity
- Input validation using express-validator
- Centralized error handling middleware
- API versioning (`/api/v1`)
- API documentation using Swagger
- Security middleware (Helmet, CORS)
- Rate limiting for API protection

---

### Frontend Features

- React-based UI
- User registration and login pages
- JWT-based session handling using localStorage
- Protected dashboard route
- Task management (Create, Read, Delete)
- API integration using Axios
- Basic error and success handling

### API Endpoints
-Auth Routes
-POST /api/v1/auth/register – Register user
-POST /api/v1/auth/login – Login user
-Task Routes (Protected)
-POST /api/v1/tasks – Create task
-GET /api/v1/tasks – Get all tasks
-GET /api/v1/tasks/:id – Get task by ID
-PUT /api/v1/tasks/:id – Update task
-DELETE /api/v1/tasks/:id – Delete task (Admin/Owner protected)

### Authentication Flow
-User registers with name, email, and password
-Password is hashed before storage
-User logs in and receives a JWT token
-Token is stored in localStorage on frontend
-Token is sent in Authorization header for protected routes

### Security Implementations
-Password hashing using bcrypt
-JWT authentication
-Role-based authorization
-Input validation for request safety
-CORS configuration for frontend communication
-Helmet for HTTP header security
-Rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Scalability Considerations
-Modular folder structure (controllers, services, routes)
-API versioning implemented
-Middleware-based architecture
-Separation of concerns
-Ready for integration with Redis caching and Docker deployment
-Easily extensible for microservices architecture
